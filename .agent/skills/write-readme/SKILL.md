# Writing Professional READMEs

When creating a README for a founding engineer project like Diligence-Zero, ensure the tone is "high-agency" and technical.

## Content Requirements
1. **The Hook**: A clear, 1-sentence value proposition at the top.
2. **Tech Stack**: Explicitly list Groq (LPU), Streamlit, and Pydantic.
3. **Core Logic**: Describe the "Source -> Diligence -> Decide" agentic workflow.
4. **Setup Instructions**:
   - Environment variables (GROQ_API_KEY).
   - Installation (`pip install streamlit groq pydantic`).
   - Execution (`streamlit run app.py`).

## Formatting Rules
- Use clean Markdown headers.
- Include a "Feature" list highlighting the "Agentic Trace" and "Conflict Resolution."
- Add a "Future Roadmap" section to show project vision.
